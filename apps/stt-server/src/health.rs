//! Periodic RTF-based GPU health monitor (WS-G).
//!
//! The Vulkan STT backend on the RX 6600 degrades in place after long uptime +
//! sustained load: the model stays GPU-resident and "GPU offload verified", but
//! sustained transcription throughput decays from ~25x realtime to ~1.3x. A
//! plain container restart clears it. The startup GPU-offload probe runs ONCE
//! at boot, so a mid-life throughput drop is never re-detected — the service
//! silently gets slow. A boolean is-GPU-loaded check is useless here (the GPU
//! is engaged the whole time); the only thing that catches this decay is
//! periodically measuring the ACTUAL realtime factor.
//!
//! This module runs that measurement on a background tokio task: sleep the
//! interval, skip the tick if a real transcription is in flight (to avoid a
//! false positive from contention), run the same `probe::run_probe` used at
//! startup, and on sustained degradation (`fail_streak` consecutive low/failed
//! probes) log loudly, flip `GET /health` to 503, and — unless
//! `STT_HEALTH_AUTORESTART=false` — `exit(1)` so the container restart
//! clears the decay.
